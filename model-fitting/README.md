# Model Fitting

The code here illustrates how the models were fitted, but beware that if you try to run it all sequentially it will take a long time (likely about a week or more depending on the speed of your machine). Models refits were actually done in stages due to computers restarting, etc. This code illustrates the process we used but this exact code was not run all in one single go.
