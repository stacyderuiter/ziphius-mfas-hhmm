# Utility Functions

All functions included in this directory, except the custom written one getLL.R, are taken directly from the R package momentuHMM (version 1.5.5) by Brett McClintock and Theo Michelot.

The current version of the package is available on CRAN and can be found at <https://github.com/bmcclintock/momentuHMM>.

The functions used here are not exported (so just installing and loading the package does not allow you to access them).

The momentuHMM package is shared under GPL3, as are these materials.
